RSVPMe - Effortless Event Planning

RSVPMe is a simple and intuitive RSVP web application that allows users to create events, send invitations, and track attendance—all without the need to register or log in. The app enables event creators to easily generate an RSVP link that can be shared with guests. Guests can simply click the link, add their name to the RSVP list, and see who else is attending. If event creators or guests want to edit their RSVP or use additional features (like the chat), they will need to register or log in.

Technologies & Tools

RSVPMe was built using a component-based architecture with the following technologies:
• React – Modular, reusable UI components for a streamlined user experience.
• TypeScript – Type safety for better scalability and maintainability.
• TailwindCSS – Utility-first styling for rapid and responsive UI development.
• Auth0 – Secure authentication for user sign-in and login.
• Framer Motion – Smooth animations and UI interactions.
• Google API – Location search and directions integration.
• Nodemailer – Contact form functionality for easy communication.
• AWS EC2 – Cloud server hosting for scalability and performance.
• PM2 – Process management for backend server reliability.
• Nginx – Reverse proxy and web server for serving the frontend efficiently.

How It Works

RSVPMe was created to eliminate unnecessary complexity in event planning. The platform provides a clean, intuitive interface that focuses on:
• Effortless Event Creation – Quickly set up events and send invites.
• Seamless RSVP Management – Easily track responses from attendees.
• Integrated Communication – Contact attendees directly to finalize event details.
• Location Assistance – Use Google Maps to help guests navigate to the event.
• Fast & Secure Access – Auth0 ensures smooth authentication and user management.

Deployment

The frontend is deployed on AWS EC2, served with Nginx, and managed using PM2 for stability. Every update follows an automated deployment process to ensure smooth and consistent performance.
